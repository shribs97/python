    "# Send SMS Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for sending SMS messages using the Fast2SMS service. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library, and the backend for sending messages is handled using the `requests` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tkinter (Usually included with Python standard library)\n",
    "- requests (`pip install requests`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fast2SMS API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this application, you need an API key from Fast2SMS. You can get it by signing up on their website [here](https://www.fast2sms.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the placeholder in the code with your actual API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"authorization\":\"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tkinter GUI Setup**:\n",
    "   - A window titled \"Send SMS Using Python\" is created with dimensions 700x500.\n",
    "   - The background color is set to `#C52233`, and a title label is displayed.\n",
    "   - Two input fields are provided for the user to enter the message and the recipient's phone number.\n",
    "   - A \"Send\" button is used to trigger the SMS sending function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functionality**:\n",
    "   - The `call()` function is triggered when the \"Send\" button is clicked.\n",
    "   - This function takes the message and phone number from the input fields and sends an HTTP POST request to the Fast2SMS API with the appropriate headers and payload.\n",
    "   - The response from the API is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone or download this repository.\n",
    "2. Ensure you have Python installed.\n",
    "3. Install the `requests` library if you don't already have it:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install requests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Replace the placeholder API key in the script with your actual Fast2SMS API key.\n",
    "5. Run the script:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python send_sms.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "6. Enter your message and recipient's phone number in the GUI and click \"Send.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- This application uses the Fast2SMS service, which might have limitations or require credits. Ensure you are familiar with the Fast2SMS API documentation and terms of service.\n",
